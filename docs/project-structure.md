# üóÑÔ∏è Project Structure  

The core of the application resides in the `src` directory, structured as follows:  

## File Structure

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files:

### Explanation of Key Directories and Files:

- **`src`**: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - **`assets`**: Includes image and SVG assets used in the application.
  - **`components`**: Contains reusable components such as `Card`, `Footer`, `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, etc.
  - **`layouts`**: Houses layout-specific components like `Admin.js` for admin panels.

For easy scalability and maintenance, organize most of the code within the features folder. Each feature folder should contain code specific to that feature, keeping things neatly separated. This approach helps prevent mixing feature-related code with shared components, making it simpler to manage and maintain the codebase compared to having many files in a flat folder structure. By adopting this method, you can enhance collaboration, readability, and scalability in the application's architecture.
