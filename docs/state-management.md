## ðŸ“Š State Management with Context API

Efficient state management is essential for optimizing your application's performance. Instead of storing all state information in one centralized location, it's beneficial to categorize and manage state based on its usage. This ensures that your application's state is modular and can be updated without unnecessary re-renders.

In this example, we are using the **React Context API** to manage and provide state across components. This pattern allows for efficient state updates, as only the relevant components will re-render when the state changes.

### Key Concepts

- **Data Categorization**: Data is divided into categories such as `companies`, `people`, and `isLoading`, making it easier to manage and optimize.
- **Fetching Data**: The `fetchData` function retrieves data from an external API, processes it, and updates the state accordingly.
- **Custom Hook**: The custom hook `useDataContext` provides easy access to the state and methods within the context, ensuring a clean and reusable API for components.
